# Rubiks Cube Scrambling Markov Chain
We construct and investigate a Markov Chain associated with scrambling the Rubiks Cube. We determine how many scrambles are needed so that the corresponding Markov Chain distribution is approximately discrete uniform. 

## Downloading Requirements
* Download PyCharm (free edition) from https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/.
* Download Python 3.10 from https://www.python.org/downloads/.

## Importing Project
* Open PyCharm and select `Get from VCS`.

## Installing Project Dependencies Automatically
- You may be prompted by PyCharm to install a Virtual Environment based on the `requirements.txt` file.
- Follow the onscreen instructions to do so.
- Make sure you specify your installed Python 3 for creating the Virtual Environment.

## Installing Project Dependencies Manually
* Open PyCharm Settings and locate the `Project: RubiksCubeMarkovChain` pane.
* Click on `Project Interpreter`.
* Add a new `VirtualEnv` environment with your system Python.
* Restart PyCharm and open its local `Terminal`.
* Type the command `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` to install project dependencies.

## Jupyter Server Instructions
* Open the local `Terminal` on PyCharm.
* Type the command `jupyter notebook` to open up a new Jupyter Server.
* Click on the `RubiksCubeMarkovChainDemo.ipynb` file to open the notebook.
* Run each code cell using the toolbar on top of the window.
